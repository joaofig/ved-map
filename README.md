Mapping the Vehicle Energy Dataset using Kotlin and KVision.

This project is an exploration into fullstack development with Kotlin and
the [KVision](https://kvision.io/) UI library. As a motivator for the 
project, we use the Vehicle Energy Dataset and the data explorations
performed in [another repository](https://github.com/joaofig/ved-explore).

## Data Setup
Before you can use this code, you must generate the required database by 
going through the 
[ved-explore repository](https://github.com/joaofig/ved-explore). At the
end, you will get an operational SQLite database with all the required 
data. Going through the Jupyter notebooks will also help you understand
the nature of the data, what information it contains, and how it could
graphically be displayed.
